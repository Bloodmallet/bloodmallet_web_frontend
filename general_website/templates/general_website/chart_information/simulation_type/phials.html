<h5>Phials</h5>
<p>
    This chart shows the impact of phials at different ranks.
</p>
<p>
    It uses the "tier appropriate"
    <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/tree/dragonflight/profiles">SimulationCraft profile</a>.
    If the fight style is neither <code>patchwerk</code> nor <code>castingpatchwerk</code> a "tier appropriate"
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloodmallet/bloodytools/tree/dev/fallback_profiles">fallback profile</a> is used to
    improve the data quality. In a custom chart if the creator provided a profile, it replaces the formerly mentioned
    profiles.
</p>
<p>
    The identified base profile is used. To get the value of phials a simulation without any phials is done and compared
    to simulations using the different mentioned phials.
