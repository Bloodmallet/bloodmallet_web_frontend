<h5>Tier Sets</h5>
<p>This chart shows how much power can be gained by adding Tier Set effects to a profile.</p>
<p>
    It uses the "tier appropriate"
    <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/tree/shadowlands/profiles">SimulationCraft profile</a>.
    If the fight style is neither <code>patchwerk</code> nor <code>castingpatchwerk</code> a "tier appropriate"
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloodmallet/bloodytools/tree/dev/fallback_profiles">fallback profile</a> is used to
    improve the data quality. In a custom chart if the creator provided a profile, it replaces the formerly mentioned
    profiles.
</p>
<p>
    The profile is used by disabling all tier set effects (see example below). Additional profiles are being created
    based on this base profile, but in these profiles more and more bonuses are being activated. Because the same
    profile is used multiple times we can observe the dps gain the enabled tier set provides for this specific profile.

# SimulationCraft example overrides
## disable the tier 28 two piece bonus
set_bonus=tier28_2pc=0

## disable the tier 28 four piece bonus
set_bonus=tier28_4pc=0

## enable the tier 28 two piece bonus
set_bonus=tier28_2pc=1

## enable the tier 28 four piece bonus
set_bonus=tier28_4pc=1

<h5>Special notes</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        SimulationCraft usually detects set bonuses and the number of equipped set items.
        However for this chart we want to control the number of active bonuses.
        Therefore we need above overrides.
    </li>
    <li>
        In SimulationCraft it's possible to have a four piece bonus active without having a two piece bonus.
        Enabling a four piece bonus does not enable the corresponding two piece bonus.
        If working with above overrides both set bonuses need to be activated this way.
    </li>
    <li>
        In SimulationCraft it's possible to enable any bonuses on any equip. Therefore even a profile without any set
        items can be used to evaluate such bonuses.
    </li>
</ul>
