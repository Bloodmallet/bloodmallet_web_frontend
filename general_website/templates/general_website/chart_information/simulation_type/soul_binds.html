<h5>Soulbinds</h5>
<p>
    This chart shows how much power a full Soulbind offers.
</p>
<p>
    It uses the "tier appropriate"
    <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/tree/shadowlands/profiles">SimulationCraft profile</a>.
    If the fight style is neither <code>patchwerk</code> nor <code>castingpatchwerk</code> a "tier appropriate"
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloodmallet/bloodytools/tree/dev/fallback_profiles">fallback profile</a> is used to
    improve the data quality. In a custom chart if the creator provided a profile, it replaces the formerly mentioned
    profiles.
</p>
<p>
    If a Covenant Legendary is equipped, its effect is replaced by Unity. Non-Covenant Legendaries stay in the profile.
    All possible fully filled Soulbind trees are generated and simulated. Conduits are used at max rank.
</p>
<p>
    The best performing path through a tree is shown. The performance of the other paths is still available in the data.

<p>
    Conduits can either use their spell id or as shown above their name in snake_case, followed by a number defining its
    rank, and followed by either a <code>1</code> to indicate an empowered conduit, or a <code>0</code> for a
    not-empowered one.
