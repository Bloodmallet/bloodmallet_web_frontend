<h5>Secondary Distributions</h5>
<p>
    This chart shows how much power different distributions of secondary stats provide.
</p>
<p>
    It uses the "tier appropriate"
    <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/tree/shadowlands/profiles">SimulationCraft profile</a>.
    If the fight style is neither <code>patchwerk</code> nor <code>castingpatchwerk</code> a "tier appropriate"
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloodmallet/bloodytools/tree/dev/fallback_profiles">fallback profile</a> is used to
    improve the data quality. In a custom chart if the creator provided a profile, it replaces the formerly mentioned
    profiles.
</p>
<p>
    At first the available sum of secondary ratings is extracted from the profile. Then the secondary ratings are
    redistributed. The lowest portion of secondary ratings per stat are 10%. Because we're dealing with 4 different
    stats this means the highest concentration on a single stat can be 70% of the sum. The sum and parts of it are
    always ratings, like the values on the items themselves.
</p>
<p>
    Example: 2000 secondaries are available. One of the distributions uses 20% of the ratings for crit, 30% for haste,
    40% for mastery, and the remaining 10% for versatility. This means 400 crit rating, 600 haste rating, 800 mastery
    rating, and 200 versatility rating will be set in this profile.

<pre>
# SimulatonCraft example override
gear_crit_rating=400
gear_haste_rating=600
gear_mastery_rating=800
gear_versatility_rating=200
</pre>

<p>
    Setting ratings as described above does not affect stat procs. E.g. trinkets.
