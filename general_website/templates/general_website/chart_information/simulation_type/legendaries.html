<h5>Legendaries</h5>
<p>
    This chart shows how much power a non-Covenant Legendary effect adds to a profile.
</p>
<p>
    It uses the "tier appropriate"
    <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/tree/dragonflight/profiles">SimulationCraft profile</a>.
    If the fight style is neither <code>patchwerk</code> nor <code>castingpatchwerk</code> a "tier appropriate"
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloodmallet/bloodytools/tree/dev/fallback_profiles">fallback profile</a> is used to
    improve the data quality. In a custom chart if the creator provided a profile, it replaces the formerly mentioned
    profiles.
</p>
<p>
    The baseline profiles have their Covenant specific Legendary or Unity (the effect swapping Legendary) equipped.
    Then, additional profiles are generated by adding non-Covenant Legendary effects. The chart shows the dps growth
    from this addition.
