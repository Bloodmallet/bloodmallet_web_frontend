    This chart shows how much power each talent provides via some stats for each. Please read the
    <a href="#talent-warning">Disclaimer</a> section carefully.

    It uses the "tier appropriate"
    <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/tree/shadowlands/profiles">SimulationCraft profile</a>.
    If the fight style is neither <code>patchwerk</code> nor <code>castingpatchwerk</code> a "tier appropriate"
    <a href="https://github.com/Bloodmallet/bloodytools/tree/dev/fallback_profiles">fallback profile</a> is used to
    improve the data quality. In a custom chart if the creator provided a profile, it replaces the formerly mentioned
    profiles.
</p>
<p>
    Stats are calculated by comparing a profile with a talent combination containing the specific talent to the same
    profile that uses no talent in that row.
