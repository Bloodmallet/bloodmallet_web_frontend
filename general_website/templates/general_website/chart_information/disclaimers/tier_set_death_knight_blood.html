    Disclaimer: The value of the Blood tier set is greatly underrepresented on the default Simulationcraft tanking model
    (1min tanking cycle, 50% uptime). This is due to both the 2p and 4p effects working off melee hits
    taken.<br /><br />
    In some scenarios, such as Primal Council or Mythic+, you will gain significantly more from this tier set than what
    is represented below.
